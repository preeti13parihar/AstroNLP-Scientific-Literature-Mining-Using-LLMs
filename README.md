# ðŸŒŒ AstroNLP: LLMs for Scientific Insight Extraction in Space Research
*Author: Preeti Parihar*  
**Technologies used**: Hugging Face Transformers, KeyBERT, arXiv RSS, Python, Google Colab  
**Research Themes**: NLP, LLM, Aerospace, Scientific Summarization, Space Informatics

AstroNLP: Built an LLM-powered research tool to summarize and analyze NASA/arXiv papers using Hugging Face Transformers and KeyBERT in Colab.

# âœ… Conclusion

In this notebook, we demonstrated the use of large language models for scientific literature mining in space research. We showed how LLMs can summarize complex papers, extract relevant keywords, compare content across papers, and support real-time input for user-defined abstracts.

This tool has applications in:
- Assisting researchers in faster literature review
- Automating technical insight extraction from NASA and arXiv datasets
- Laying the groundwork for mission planning or proposal generation

Future improvements may include domain adaptation with fine-tuned models and deeper integration with citation graphs or NASA ADS APIs.
